mediawiki2git
=============

These are a bunch of scripts that were use to extract all content,
including history, out of the Windstille mediawiki and convert it into
plain text files to be placed in the SVN repository.

The scripts where written to get the job done, so they won't work
without adoption in other Wikis.
