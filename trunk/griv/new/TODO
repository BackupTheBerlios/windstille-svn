[[ Griv ToDo ]]

* multi-threading for the interface
* multi-threading in the tile generator for multicore
* faster image handling, FreeImage is not good enough
* do something about the seams on tile borders
* proper handling of locked DB
* faster incremental tile generation
* variable size images on the workspace

Image Library Requirements:
===========================

* fast JPEG thumbnailing would be a plus (FreeImage, EPEG)

* fast width/height reading from file header (libjpeg, libpng)

* support for PNG, JPEG, etc.

* generation of subregion images without a copy
