[[ Griv ToDo ]]

* implement SoftwareSurface::get_jpeg_data()
* implement crop
* implement scale

* multi-threading in the tile generator for multicore
* faster image handling, FreeImage is not good enough
* do something about the seams on tile borders (hard, need to save a 1px border, but that screws up the JPEG compression)
* proper handling of locked DB
* faster incremental tile generation
* griv name is already taken

  Possible alternative names: ZoomIV, ZUIIV, VIIUZ, viuz, zoiv zoui, magzoi, gig

* How to avoid duplicate entries in the queue?
* figure out why the thing crashes

* File stuff should really be seperate from Tile getting -> Seperate worker thread?
* need to display the thread status graphically somehow

Image Library Requirements:
===========================

* fast JPEG thumbnailing would be a plus (FreeImage, EPEG -> See jpeglib tools, transup.c)

* fast width/height reading from file header (libjpeg, libpng)

* support for PNG, JPEG, XCF, etc.

* generation of subregion images without a copy
