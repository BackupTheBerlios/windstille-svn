griv - A Zoomable Image Viewer zoomview 
=======================================

griv is a image viewer that allows you to directly zoom into large
collection of thumbnails down to the images original size. Its goal is
to allow its viewer to view 100'000 images at once, fluently without
any noticable load times. griv requires currently a tile cache to make
this work, which require around 1.5 times as much diskspace as the
original image data.


Required Libraries:
===================

libmhash-dev
libglew1.5-dev
libjpeg62-dev
scons
OpenGL


Bugs:
=====

When zooming into an images one will see noticable seams at the areas
where the tiles meet. A possible fix for this would be to add a 1px
width border to the tiles, but that would screw up the tile generation
process from JPEG data.
