griv - A Zoomable Image Viewer zoomview 
=======================================

griv is a image viewer that allows you to directly zoom into large
collection of tens of thousand of images from tiny thumbnails down to
the images original size fluently with small loadtimes or no loss of
interactivity. It accomplishes this by keeping a tile cache which
stores not only thumbnails for one size, but thumbnails of many
different sizes. This thumbnail cache requires at maximum 1.5x times
as much storage as the images themselves.

griv can also be used to view gigapixel sized images, it however
currently requires the tiles for that to be generated previously,
which can take quite a bit of time and memory.


Required Libraries:
===================

On Ubuntu you have to do a:

apt-get install \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libmhash-dev \
  libglew1.5-dev \
  libjpeg62-dev \
  scons

And make sure you have OpenGL installed. For other distributions
library names might be a little different.


Running:
========

griv comes with a number of sub commands, allowing the user to either
view images or pre generate thumbnails. The most basic command is:

 ./griv view [FILES]...

Which display the given files. To pregenerate only the small
thumbnails you use:

 ./griv thumbgen [FILES]...

To generate not only the small thumbnails, but all tiles you use:

 ./griv prepare [FILES]...

The other available commands are mostly for debugging and have little
actualy use.

When you do not supply a list of files griv will display all files in
the database.

Via the -d flag you can specifiy a database, so that you can have
different databases for different files.


SpaceNavigator Support:
=======================

griv supports the Space Navigator via the Open Source spacenavd daemon:

 * http://spacenav.sourceforge.net

The 3Dconnexion's official 3dxsrv daemon is not supported, neither is
directly reading from /dev/input/eventX.
