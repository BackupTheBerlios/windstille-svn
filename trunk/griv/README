griv - A Zoomable Image Viewer zoomview 
=======================================

griv is a image viewer that allows you to directly zoom into large
collection of tens of thousand of images from tiny thumbnails down to
the images original size fluently with little or no noticable
loadtimes. It accomplishes this by keeping a tile cache which stores
not only thumbnails for one size, but thumbnails of many different
sizes. This thumbnail cache requires at maximum 1.5x times as much
storage as the images themselves.

griv can also be used to view gigapixel sized images, it however
currently requires the tiles for that to be generated previously,
which can take quite a bit of time and memory.


Required Libraries:
===================

On Ubuntu you have to do a:

apt-get install \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libmhash-dev \
  libglew1.5-dev \
  libjpeg62-dev \
  scons

And make sure you have OpenGL installed. For other distributions
library names might be a little different.

Bugs:
=====

When zooming into an images beyond its original size one will see
noticable seams at the areas where the tiles meet. A possible fix for
this would be to add a 1px width border to the tiles, but that would
slow down the tile generation process from JPEG data, so it might
never get implemented.
