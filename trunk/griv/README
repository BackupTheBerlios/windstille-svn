griv - A Zoomable Image Viewer zoomview 
=======================================

griv is a image viewer that allows you to directly zoom into large
collection of thumbnails down to the images original size. Its goal is
to allow its viewer to view 100'000 images at once, fluently without
any noticable load times. griv requires a tile cache to make this
work, which require around 1.5x times as much diskspace as the original
image data. 


Required Libraries:
===================

On Ubuntu you have to do a:

apt-get install \
  libsqlite3-dev \
  libmhash-dev \
  libglew1.5-dev \
  libjpeg62-dev \
  scons

And make sure you have OpenGL installed. For other distributions
library names might be a little different.


Bugs:
=====

When zooming into an images one will see noticable seams at the areas
where the tiles meet. A possible fix for this would be to add a 1px
width border to the tiles, but that would slow down the tile
generation process from JPEG data, so it might never get implemented.
