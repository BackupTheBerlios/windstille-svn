[[ Griv ToDo ]]

* add 8x8 JPEG is larger then RAW, else JPEG always wins

1920x1080: (64x64) 30x17=510, (32x32) 60x34=2040, (16x16) 120x68=8160, (4x4) 480x270=129600
~100MB for fullscreen 16x16 Thumbs
~32 textures for 129600 thumbs

16x16 -> 1KB
1000 thumbnails -> 1MB
10'000 thumbnails -> 10MB
100'000 thumbnails -> 100MB (graphic card gets full) -> Solution: smaller thumbnails, also unload from GFX card, but keep software backstore

* need to properly check for collisions in the database
* implement fast crop
* implement linear blending scale
* move image sorting code on workspace over
* request lower res tiles, before requesting highres tiles
* move JPEG decoding in a seperate thread so that the database thread can run free with database stuff 
* jpegtran *can't* do crop of large scale JPEGs in small amount of
  space, so cropping with libjpeg likely won't work

* multi-threading in the tile generator for multicore
* faster image handling, FreeImage is not good enough
* do something about the seams on tile borders (hard, need to save a 1px border, but that screws up the JPEG compression)
* faster incremental tile generation
* griv name is already taken

  Possible alternative names: ZoomIV, ZUIIV, VIIUZ, viuz, zoiv zoui, magzoi, gig, zuiview

* How to avoid duplicate entries in the queue?
* figure out why the thing crashes -> move viewer thread into main thread

* File stuff should really be seperate from Tile getting -> Seperate worker thread?
* need to display the thread status graphically somehow
