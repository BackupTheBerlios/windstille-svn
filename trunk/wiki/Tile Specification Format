The tile file, ie. the tile which defines which graphics are used for a tile, if the tile is collidable or not, etc., should support the following features:

* multi frame animated tiles
* TexCoord animated tiles (waterfall)
* multiple tiles per image
* efficent storage of tiles in OpenGL textures
* support for the different graphics layers (color/light/highlight)
 
Below is what we currently have, more or less, its far from final.
