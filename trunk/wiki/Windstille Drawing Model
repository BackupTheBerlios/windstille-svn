= Drawing Operations =
To bring images on screen you have to execute drawing operations. There are several different types of drawing operations. Each of them depend on a number of parameters.

== Common Parameters ==
These parameters are used for all drawing operations
* Position, Rotation, Scale -- These 3 values together are called a modelview transform and are encoded as a 4x4 Matrix
* Color -- the color is multiplied with each pixel that is drawn
* blend_sfactor, blend_dfactor -- factors that are used for blending pixels with alpha values on screen (see glBlendFunc for details)

== Text ==
Writes text on the screen.
* Font -- The font that is used to write the characters (the font has additional attributes like color of the text)
