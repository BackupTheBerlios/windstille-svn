The following people could be needed:

* somebody good at programming (C++, Ruby for the editor)
* somebody good at writing story and dialog
* somebody good at animating human bodies (thats something I'll could try, am however not much good at)
* somebody doing 2d graphics (that would be me)
* some voice actors would be fun
* sound effects and music people, there is currently some music, but no sound effects
* somebody good at animating human faces, first version will probally stay away from this, but its something I would like to try in the future

As always with [[Free Software]] projects, no payment, all just for fun.
