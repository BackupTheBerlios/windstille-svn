The following people could be needed:

* somebody good at programming (C++, Ruby for the editor)
* somebody good at writing story and dialog
* somebody good at animating human bodies (thats something [[Grumbel]] could try, however he might not be much good at)
* somebody doing 2d graphics ([[Grumbel]] will do this)
* some voice actors would be fun (at least two female voices, plus a few male ones)
* sound effects and music people, there is currently some music, but no sound effects
* somebody good at animating human faces, first version will probally stay away from this, but its something I would like to try in the future

As always with [[Free Software]] projects, no payment, all just for fun.

== Tasks ==

The following tasks are available, make sure you check with [irc://irc.freenode.net/#windstille] IRC Channel first to make sure that those tasks are not yet compeleted or picked up by somebody else, since those task lists always tend to get outdated quickly:

=== Blender ===

* rig the powersuit-character and the powersuit-less characters properly (data/blender/hero.blend)
* create proper animations for walk, run, jump, duck, turn-around, aim and shoot, simple sloppy test animation would for the beginning be enough, just to figure out the movement and timing
* make sure all animations are exported and available in the game

=== Coding ===

* fix player movement behaviour
* integrate all available animations
* implement the control dialog in code with opengl commands so that its properly resizable, make the displayed text configurable by scripting, figure out a way to display special icons, aka arrows, for 'up/down/left/right'
* add tab-completion, line editing and other readline-like functions to the console
* add a std::streambuf for the console
