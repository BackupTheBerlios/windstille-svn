The following people could be needed:

* somebody good at programming (C++, Ruby for the editor)
* somebody good at writing story and dialog
* somebody good at animating human bodies (thats something [[Grumbel]] could try, however he might not be much good at)
* somebody doing 2d graphics ([[Grumbel]] will do this)
* some voice actors would be fun (at least two female voices, plus a few male ones)
* sound effects and music people, there is currently some music, but no sound effects
* somebody good at animating human faces, first version will probally stay away from this, but its something I would like to try in the future

As often with [[Free Software]] game projects, no payment, all for fun, reputation and experience.

== Tasks ==

The following tasks are available, make sure you check with [irc://irc.freenode.net/#windstille] IRC Channel first to make sure that those tasks are not yet compeleted or picked up by somebody else, since those task lists always tend to get outdated quickly:

=== Blender ===

* rig the powersuit-character and the powersuit-less characters properly (data/blender/hero.blend)
* create proper animations for walk, run, jump, duck, turn-around, aim and shoot, simple sloppy test animation would for the beginning be enough, just to figure out the movement and timing
* make sure all animations are exported and available in the game
* discuss what sort of bad guys will be needed and create models for them
* you will move between levels in a transport ship, this requires a model (or maybe a 2D based sprite instead?) - this needs to be discussed and made
* animations for going stairs up and down, [http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/tmp/windstille-stairs-2005-07-17.png stairs look like this]

=== Coding ===

* fix player movement behaviour
* integrate all available animations
* implement the control dialog in code with opengl commands so that its properly resizable, make the displayed text configurable by scripting, figure out a way to display special icons, aka arrows, for 'up/down/left/right'
* add tab-completion, line editing and other readline-like functions to the console
* edit flexlay to be able to load new format windstille levels (this task is Ruby, not C++)
* boxes or other items that you can push and pull
* new font renderer, clanlib's is very buggy and has various issues. Perhaps using [http://homepages.paradise.net.nz/henryj/code/index.html#FTGL ftgl], an interface between freetype and opengl 
* initialising/loading/saving script variables (this is already being worked on by JamesG and MazteB)
* collision detection between the player and other objects (Godrin is already working on this)
* weapons and firing (MazteB may already be working on this?)
* add a player-holding-torch lighting effect
* fix bugs - you can find some in the [http://svn.berlios.de/viewcvs/windstille/trunk/BUGS?view=markup SVN BUGS file]
* write a GameObject/Entity that simulates a 'laser display' or however you call things like [http://www.laserist.org/Laserist/2003Awards/LFI_Static_Cubi%20Bubi_B.jpg this], ie. something that uses a laser to project a 2d vector object on a wall, color of the laser should be configurable
* write a Squirrel-mode for Emacs
* write a function that converts a Squirrel object to a human readable std::string, might be solvable with squirrel internals, print() however doesn't do a good job, since it uses a stream and secondly gives '(bool)' instead of 'true', same for classes, tables and arrays
* implement stairs, see blender task list above
* implement an elevator a platform onto which one can step on and once one presses 'use' it moves up or down, if 'use' is pressed while its moving it should inverse the direction
* add a proper way to define near/far clipping planes in ClanLib (currently defaults to -1000, 1000)
* change the console so that each expression that returns a value automatically prints it
* write a LispReader so that one doesn't have to use ListIterator
* Squirrel-table to Lisp contains a memory hole
