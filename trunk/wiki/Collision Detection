Basic features that need to be handled by the physic/collision engine: 

* properly detection of the side at which two boxes collide so that the game can react as expected (player pushes a box, player jumps on a moving platform from below, player jumps on an enemy vs gets hit by an enemy, etc.)
* allow to stack crates, boxes and stuff
* allow to shoot in a stack of boxes and let the stack collapse
* conveyor belts
* slopes in the tilemap

Stuff that is not needed:

* rotating boxes, while probally pretty, they cause more throuble then good, both on the programming side as well as on the gameplay side (what happens when you jump on a box which has a 45 degree angel?)

For box-collision see:

for pixel-collision see:

src/collision/

However the pixel-based  collision is most likly not going to be used.
