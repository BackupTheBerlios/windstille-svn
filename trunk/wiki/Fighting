Some thoughts on fighting in Windstille.

== Human Mode ==

Another World had a very interesting way to fight. You had a gun that you could charge, in three stages:

# fire a normal shoot
# build a shield infront of you
# fire a huge blast that will crack a shild or destroy a wall

Enemies only used shields and normal shoots and shilds had a limited amount of time how long they hold, multiple shields were possible. A single shoot that hit would kill a enemy or you. So you had to constantly keep your shild up while at the same time trying to charge up a powershoot to destroy the enemies shild.

Flashback is somewhat similar, but here you can survive a few hits and the shild isn't a weapon firing mode, but a seperate item. Shield only opens up for a second and closes again, so it all depends on your timing to open the shild shortly before the enemy fires a shoot. Enemies don't use any shilds if I remember correctly.

AstroyBoy uses a rather special weapon based fight system, each punch to an enemy fills up your powermeter, once its full you can fire a special attack, so fighting focuses on filling up the meter and starting special attacks so that they hit the most enemies.
