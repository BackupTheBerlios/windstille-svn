Controls in Windtille will be configurable, this works by mapping keyboard keys, joystick buttons or whatever input device you have available to a virtual controller. This virtual controller will be more or less SNES like, meaning you have a primary button (A), a secondary button (B), additional X and Y buttons, a digital directional pad (left/right/up/down), a start/pause button, select button and L and R triggers.
