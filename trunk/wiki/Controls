Controls in Windtille will be configurable, this works by mapping keyboard keys, joystick buttons or whatever input device you have available to a virtual controller. This virtual controller will be more or less SNES like, meaning you have a primary button (A), a secondary button (B), additional X and Y buttons, a digital directional pad (left/right/up/down), a start/pause button, select button and L and R triggers. When using the a keyboard this can be mapped as 'wasd' + 'qe' + 'enter' + 'escape' + 'cursorkeys'.

Controls in general should be context sensitive meaning there don't necessarily is a hard mapping between a button and what you do, this could for example mean that the jump executed when you are standing infront of a ledge is a different one than when standing on normal ground or on the edge of a cliff or that when you walk against a wall you halt or when walking against a box you automatically start to push the box.

== Open Questions ==

* Should drawing the weapon be a push&hold or a toggle? => drawing should be a toggle, but aiming should be a push&hold thing
* Is there a need for a seperate aim button when holding the gun (Resident Evil style)? => yes
* What about Turrican-style surround shooting? => can be done via aiming
* Is the three-mode style gun usage to complicated (pull, aim, shoot)? => maybe, not sure, the point behind it is that you should not run around with a gun all the time in the city, another solution would be to have to equip the gun in the inventory... The more I think about it the less of a good idea it seems, best is probally to have 'aim' automatically a draw the gun too, instead of having that a seperate action
