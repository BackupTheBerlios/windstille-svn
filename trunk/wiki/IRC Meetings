[[IRC Meeting 2]]

Short summary of [[IRC Meeting 2]]
* gold hunt athmopshere (maybe something else than gold)
* we're on a small mining planets
* people get there in the hope to get rish
* you have to work for "bosses" that provide you with mining facilities but you have to share your profits with them
* the planet is a not so nice planet, but you can easily live and breath there
* there is few police/law enforcement present
* most people settle their issues with themselfes (that's why everyone has a gun)
* There is some economy around the miners, like bars and shops
* Jane will be the main character of the story she has worked as miner in the past
* but now is a bounty hunter/mercenary or something
* She has a modified miner suit
* on which she added some weapons and more armor and other extras...
* She mostyle works for miner boss #1...
* In milestone2 we'll also meet the barkeeper
* and eventually boss#2 that often is in competition to boss#1
* Bosses typically use a place on the planet and start mining there
* If the mine has found gold you have to be carefull and guard the place
* as other "evil" miners will try to overtake the mine
* or people trying to steal the mined gold and such
* though most mines only find small amounts of gold and are not interesting
* Bosses typically switch mining places from time to time...
* There are other planets but we don't know much of them
* Traveling is expensive and people mostly feel home on the colonie after living there for years
* ok that's all I remember for now
* windstille releases will have episodic character like a TV show
* colonies just places where people live on the planet
