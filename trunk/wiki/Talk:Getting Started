I know this is a pain, but would it be possible to do (nightly? weekly?) development builds?  I'm not working with the source much, so I just want to get a feel of where the game is at.  As grumbel said, the script should be written for the gameplay, and not vice-versa.

I think this is a bad idea. The script might be important but actually writing the game requires 100 times more work. I think the more people taking the time to get the game to compile (perhaps finding and fixing minor bugs in the process), the better. If you can do some coding work whilst you are there, even better. Also, I'm pretty sure you meant to say "the gameplay should be written for the script, and not vice versa", as what you did say implies the script is unimportant, which I don't think you meant.

Actually, I meant what I said.  IIRC, in my last conversation with grumbel, he said it's our primary priority to make sure that the gameplay is fun.  We should write a plot that fits in with the gameplay, whatever that may be, instead of creating gameplay around a plot.
