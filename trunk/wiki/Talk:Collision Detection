Some questions concerning the collision handling:
# Should we use constant or increasing speed, while pushing/pulling boxes ?
# Moving the player avatar is done in constant speed, yes? I've not compiled the game yet.
# What about elasticity - do we need this?
# What about pushing more than 1 box? Just this be prevented?
