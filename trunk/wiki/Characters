One of the many contract workers which work for the Northern Star Mining cooroperation. The NSM often hires people and send them out to the different colonies to dig for resources. Their income is connected to the amount of resources which they collect, so if stuff doesn't work that right, they might quickly lose interesting, since only resources bring them income. Most of the time they are send out to a colonie for a few weeks or month, then send to another one, once the given resource region is harvested. Overall they can be hard workers, but only if the resources can motivate them.
