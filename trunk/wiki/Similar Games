While Windstille tries to be somewhat original, however there is are obviously some games that have been a huge inspiration.

== Another World ==

One of the most athmospaeric games ever created. Its also basically 100% scriptbased, meaning no screen will play the same as the one before.

== Flashback ==

Still probally one of the best animated games ever, especially the later levels where you travel around in a city had quite a bit of influence on the 'human-part' of Windstille.

== Metroid ==

Obviously a heavy inspiration for the powersuit part, however Windstille should try to be quite a bit slower, making the action more real and less jumpy. Metroid Zero Mission actually also contains a short 'human-part', however that is rather purly executed, still holds some nice ideas.

== Turrican ==

Turrican is obviously inspired by Metroid and so Windstille is also inspired by Turrican. Originally, meaning the first few days/weeks of development, Windstille reused some Turrican gfx as fillers.

== Mission Elevator/Elevator Action ==

Rather obscure reference, however was probally the first 2D game that had a somewhat 'realistic' environment.
