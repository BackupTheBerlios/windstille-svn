I like the story part from quickflash that Jane is getting bored about mining with 21 and starts modifying her suit in free time. Also the competitor being her sister might be interesting.

I also like the part from pifactorial about boss having a mining company at first that gets "overtaken" once the non loyal worker gave the codes away. Though I'd simply change the ending so that boss starts a new business new with his money left. No need to have a too strong relation between Jane and Boss (which would be the case with boss being bankcrupt and Jane being the only one staying with him).

: I fully agrree with MatzeB's arguments, that sounds like it would make the story more 'real' (or better 'believable').<BR/>The idea with making the boss Janes sister ist a bit too much IMHO, though. -- [[User:Hoehrer|Hoehrer]] 18:31, 4 Jul 2005 (BST)
