While the [[Plot]] page goes already into the dialog and the details, this page should focus more on the overall structure, the events that happen and less on how each and every character reacts to them. As with all plot stuff nothing is really set in stone and you are welcome to add your ideas to the [[Ideas]] page or to the Discussion one of this page if you prefer.
