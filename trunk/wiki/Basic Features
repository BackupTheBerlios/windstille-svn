This is a list of basic features we should either get from additional libraries or write small classes ourself.

= Basics =
* Setting up Fullscreen/Windowed OpenGL Context
* Gathering Input from Keyboard/Joystick/Mouse

= Graphics/Sprites =
* Loading images (png, jpeg would be a nice addition but is not mandatory) and creating opengl textures from them
* A system that gathers all drawing commands, sorts them and maybe optimizes them for opengl
* The drawing system should be statefull to allow translation and maybe scaling and rotating of following drawing commands. It should be possible to maintain a stack of such transformations.
* Sprite Handling. Sprites should support the following features (if we go for 3d sprites only we might not need these)
* We need Fonts to display Text on screen
** Several Animation switchable animations defined from a series of images. The animation speed should be freely adjustable.
** Animation images can be extracted from bigger images (texture coordinate animation)
** Support for reversing animations and mirroring/flipping the images will reduce the number of images needed.
** We might have to extend sprites to support the 3 layer displaying of windstille

= Sound =
* A way to send sound to the soundcard.
* Load wav and ogg files
* Stream ogg files for background music
* Mix several sound sources together
* Positional audio (a fake solution with might be enough where you can just adjuts panning/volume)
