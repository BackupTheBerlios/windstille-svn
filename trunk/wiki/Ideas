== Fist Fights ==

The game is meant to take place on a rough outerspace colonie on a distant planet, so its more or less natural that conflict arises at times, a bit of fist fighting could help resolve that. The fight system should probally implemented as a mix of something like having a uppercut, a face punch and a belly punch and a block (in form of high, middle, low), either the animation itself should give hints on the oponents actions or DDR/Viewtiefull Joe like explizit markers.

Traveling between Planets should happen in this:

shuttle. A smaller dropship might be used to carry the player from one mission to the next

== Mining Minerals ==

The collonie will mine some minerals. One idea could be that these minerals could be used as fuel/energie source. Gameplay wise this could be used so that:

* the player can recover energie from collecting minerals
* minerals can detonate when you shoot on them

== Cargo Ship ==

Every few weeks/month a cargo ship comes and collects the minerals:

== Some History ==

Project report
Colony #: 003456-A
Company: Inviro Mining
Manager: Nicholas Nantu
Date: 2468-03-23

The first ships have landed on the planet and have begun to setup the initial
industries. The colonists have established 3 prime cities and have named the
planet Windstille.

As per our preliminary reports the planet seems abaoundant in plant and animal
life as well as rich in mineral deposits.

***CONFIDENTIAL***
We have already issued orders to our group on the planet to claim as much of
the land as they can before the others come.

There however seems to be a base for pirates established on the planet. We will
keep this information hidden for the time being. NOTE: We should hire a merc
to solve this problem for us asap before it get's well known or out of hand.

Current recommendation: DENY any and all pirate rummors.

Our scouts report a spider like creature in the forrest that seems to be
sentient. This is not desired since that would require us to re-locate to a
different planet due to the colonisation laws.

Current recommendation: hire a mercenaries to eliminate any and all sentients native to the planet.

Mineral deposits secured(so far): gold, silver, platinum, uranium and an unknown mineral that seems to be highly concentrated with energy.

---CONFIDENTIAL---
