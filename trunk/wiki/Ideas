== Fist Fights ==

The game is meant to take place on a rough outerspace colonie on a distant planet, so its more or less natural that conflict arises at times, a bit of fist fighting could help resolve that. The fight system should probally implemented as a mix of something like having a uppercut, a face punch and a belly punch and a block (in form of high, middle, low), either the animation itself should give hints on the oponents actions or DDR/Viewtiefull Joe like explizit markers.
