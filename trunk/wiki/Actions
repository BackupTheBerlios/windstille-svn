The game has basically 3 different control modes, one is with the powersuit, one is for player without the powersuit and a seperate mode is there for the player with his weapon equiped without the powersuit.

== Moving around without a gun / Adventure Mode ==

Moving around without the gun puts you basically into an adventure-mode, ie. a mode where you don't spend most of your time fighting, but talking to people, exploring city, factories and stuff.

== Gunfights without the powersuit ==

When you meet somebody in the adventure mode that you need to fight, you have the ability to draw your gun.  This mode should focus on allowing the player to perform a close-distance gun fight, walking/jumping in this mode is limited to what makes sense with a drawn gun.

== Fighting with the powersuit ==

When you have the powersuit equiped the gameplay changes quite a bit in that it gives you much more strength, higher jumps, power for your weapons and simply different weapons. However the powersuit is not allowed in some areas and won't be of much use in other, ie. when you want to sneak into enemy territory. The powersuit will also not be available at its full strength from the beginning of the game.
