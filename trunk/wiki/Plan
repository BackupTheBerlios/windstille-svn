== Respawning ==

Its not yet clear how respawing should be handled, one way would be
that the player respawns in a hospital in the city when he is
critically hurt (GTA-like), another solution would be to simply
respawn at the last rooms entrance (Beyond Good&Evil). 

== New Game ==

Before starting a new game it might be wise to force the user to
configure its input, else the game itself might get confusing.

Once the user starts a new game a scrolling text which gives a general
introduction about the backstory of the game is presented:

"Its the year 2248[1], after mankind has developed faster-then-light
travel they have begun colonizing other planets and building up
industries on other planets in the search for usefull good, one could
call it a second gold rush. Some say mankind has spread faster then
good for them, others hail the technological progress. Some colonies
have become quickly abandoned after no worthy goods have shown up on a
planet, other flourish at the same time and some struggle for their
survival. This story takes place on one of the struggeling colonies,
resources are rare and goods are seldom, the people struggle for their
survival. We are going to tell the story of Jane[2], a Mercenary on
planet X-Gamma-5..."

(text runs out and the game fades over to the apartment of Jane, where
Jane is just doing a VR training in her new powersuit)
