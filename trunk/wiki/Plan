== Starting the game ==

On startup the game should present its logo (Windstille), a short list
of credits and copyright, combined by some fade-overs and light
effects, after that it should fade over to the main menu.

== Main Menu ==

The main menu should offer the user different save-slots from which he
can select one, a exit button and an option menu. A bonus would be the
function to rewatch cutscenes and dialog via a special menu.

== Option Menu ==

The option menu should allow to tweak the standard meta-game
options, volume, fullscreen/window mode, language, controlls
(important!) and such. The option menu should be available from inside
the game as well.

== Save game Slots ==

Saving will be based on slots, not files, when the user enters an
empty slot a new game starts, if he enters a non-empty slot the game
will continue at the last save-point. Saving will be mostly automatic.

The game will save automatically when you quit and will offer a continue
button in the menu that brings you back to where you quit.

== Respawning ==

Its not yet clear how respawing should be handled, one way would be
that the player respawns in a hospital in the city when he is
critically hurt (GTA-like), another solution would be to simply
respawn at the last rooms entrance (Beyond Good&Evil). 

== New Game ==

Before starting a new game it might be wise to force the user to
configure its input, else the game itself might get confusing.

Once the user starts a new game a scrolling text which gives a general
introduction about the backstory of the game is presented:

"Its the year 2248[1], after mankind has developed faster-then-light
travel they have begun colonizing other planets and building up
industries on other planets in the search for usefull good, one could
call it a second gold rush. Some say mankind has spread faster then
good for them, others hail the technological progress. Some colonies
have become quickly abandoned after no worthy goods have shown up on a
planet, other flourish at the same time and some struggle for their
survival. This story takes place on one of the struggeling colonies,
resources are rare and goods are seldom, the people struggle for their
survival. We are going to tell the story of Jane[2], a Mercenary on
planet X-Gamma-5..."

(text runs out and the game fades over to the apartment of Jane, where
Jane is just doing a VR training in her new powersuit)

== Virtual Reality Training ==

VR Training shows the player what actions are available and how to use
them. It does this by guiding the player through a little course where
he needs all the available actions to make it to the end, an AI-voice
will give commands on which actions are currently needed.

# Walking: the player is commanded to walk from his current position to a marked new position
# Running: the player is commanded to walk from his current position to a new one, the way is however bloked by a conveyour belt which he can pass without changing to running mode
# Jumping: the player has to jump over a small abyss, if he doesn't make the jump he will get reset to a position infront of the abyss
# Climbing: the player has to make a 'hang-jump' (Up+Jump) to climb onto a little mountain
# Duck: the player has to make its way under a block, under the block is a conveyour belt, so ducking will let him glide under it
# Rolling: same as above but this time the player has to run and then make a roll under the block, optionally this might also be done with sneaking

After movement training is over, the VR Training will switch over to weapon training, where the player has to grab a gun and use it to shoot a bunch of dummy targets (double-pyramids or something like that). Also available should be granates, satches carges and shild.

== Back in Real World ==

(onces done with the training Jane takes a shower)

(seconds later her communicator starts to ring)

(Jane dresses up and leaves the shower to take the call)

Boss[4]: "Hi Jane, looks like there is a new job coming up."

Jane: "Cool, what's it about?"

Boss: "Can't give you details at the moment, but Bob[5] at Jimbos[6]
bar will fill you in. Hurry cause we might not be the only one
interested in that job."

Jane: "Ok, on my way."

(Jane grabs her jaked and leaves her apartment and goes to Jimbos bar,
just a few screens away)

Jane: "Hi, Bob. I heard you might have a job."

Bob: "Jane, what a suprise! Yep, looks like one of our mineral-hunters got into
trouble. He moved deep into the nothern forest and got trapped, we
got the emergency call half an hour ago, but none of our guys seems
to be too willing to help out.  They're all afraid of some ghost story floating
around about that forest. 5'000 credits are in there for you if you
bring back our man alive."

Jane: "I'll take it, could really need a bit more money.  Been a long time since my last job."

Bob: "Great, Here's his last position."

(Communicator call from Boss)

Boss: "Got the job?"

Jane: "Yep, everything is set.  Come get me."

Boss: "Okay, lets meet on the roof, will be there in a minute."

Jane: "Yep"

(Jane goes to the roof and enters the spaceship, piloted by Boss)

(little cutscene that shows spaceship flying over to the northern
forest)

(Jane gets dropped at the forest)

Boss: "Ok Jane, this is as far as I can bring you, you have to make
the rest on your own. I'll stay in contact."

== Forest Action Sequence ==

The forest is full of creatures, some/most hostile and agressive,
nobody really knows where they did come from, but rumor is that they
are caused by some genetic material which was spread over the forest
as a cargo ship of the Bio-Corp[7] crashed into the forest, however
that incident has never been confirmed officially and since it
happened in the early days of colonization no proper record of the
happenings is available and truth to be told, nobody really cares
anymore, people have other problems these days.

(Jane now goes hunting down the forest, shooting spiders and other
animals that cross the way)

Automapping and regular radio messages guide the way through the
forest.

The level will play both above and below the ground, the below-ground
sections will allow to greate labyrinth like structures, which the
above ground only allow in a rather limited fasion.



(Final boss is a large spider into which net the mineral-hunter has
fallen)
