Notes about blender models:

- 1 blender unit corresponds to 32pixels in game
  (if you use the default 800x600 game resolution)
- When looking at a character turned left from the side, coordinate axes are:
    z -> up
    y -> right
    x -> back
  (the exporter will convert these to windstille coordinates which are
   x->right, y -> down, z -> back)
- Each blender object should use exactly 1 texture on all it's faces.
- You should animate your models with armatures. The exporter will grab all
  defined actions for the armature and export these. You are only allowed to
  have 1 armature object in the scene at the moment (but this armature can have
  multiple bones of course)
- Only for information you don't have to care about this: UVs in blender are
    u -> right
    v -> up
  UVs in windstille are
    u -> right
    v -> down
- Take a look at the console output to see warnings and errors from the script
- You should specify additional attributes for the actions by creating a blender
  textobject with name "actionconfig". You can then specify lines like this
  (this example states that for action MyActionName frames 5 - 40 should be
   exported every 8th frame should be exported and the animation should be
   played back with speed 5.7 later. The speed and samplerate part are optional)

  # Sampe actionconfig file

  MyActionName 5 - 40
  AnotherAction 1 - 30 speed 5.0

  You can append additional options at the line. They are each optional but you
  have to specify them in this order.
    speed FLOAT_NUMBER      the default fps speed the animation should be played
    samplerate INT_NUMBER   only sample every nth frame in blender
    marker NAME INT_NUMBER  remembers a named marker at a specific frame. These
                            markers will be used by the program for purposes
                            like finding out when you can safely change
                            animations. You can specify multiple markers.
