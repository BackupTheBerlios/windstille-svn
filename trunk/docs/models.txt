Notes about blender models:

- 1 blender unit corresponds to 32pixels in game
  (if you use the default 800x600 game resolution)
- When looking at a character turned left from the side, coordinate axes are:
    z -> up
    y -> right
    x -> back
  (the exporter will convert these to windstille coordinates which are
   x->right, y -> down, z -> back)
- Each blender object should use exactly 1 texture on all it's faces.
- You should animate your models with armatures. The exporter will grab all
  defined actions for the armature and export these. You are only allowed to
  have 1 armature object in the scene at the moment (but this armature can have
  multiple bones of course)
- Only for information you don't have to care about this: UVs in blender are
    u -> right
    v -> up
  UVs in windstille are
    u -> right
    v -> down
