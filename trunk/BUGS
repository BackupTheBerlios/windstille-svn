Windstille Bugs
===============

- if you keep alternately holding down left and right, and sometimes
  hold both at once, you can sometimes get the player stuck

- Jane's hat is white, caused by one mesh using two textures, could be
  fixed in either the exporter or in the model itself

- when a Windstille is in window mode a window infront of it will
  cause graphical errors, this is caused by the non-pbuffer based
  lightmap rendering, implementing proper pbuffer would fix itx 
   
- Pressing left (or right), jump and up at the same time throws an
  exception that causes the game to exit:

  std::exception: No marker with name 'RightFoot' defined in action 'Stand'

  in general the game shouldn't crash when stuff isn't found, but
  instead fallback to placeholders and give a error message on the console

- sometimes (very rarly) the game freezes at startup

- can't Ctrl-c the game
