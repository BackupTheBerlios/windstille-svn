Windstille Bugs
===============

- if you keep alternately holding down left and right, and sometimes
  hold both at once, you can sometimes get the player stuck

- there is a thin line just under half way up the bottom row of tiles
  in the VR room which for some reason is in front of the player rather
  than behind

- Jane's hat is white, caused by one mesh using two textures, could be
  fixed in either the exporter or in the model itself

- when a Windstille is in window mode a window infront of it will
  cause graphical errors, this is caused by the non-pbuffer based
  lightmap rendering, implementing proper pbuffer would fix itx 
   
- Pressing left (or right), jump and up at the same time throws an exception that causes the game to exit

- there might be a bug in IFileStream:

  IFileStream fin(filename);
  std::istreambuf_iterator<char> first(fin), last;
  std::vector<char> buffer(first, last);
