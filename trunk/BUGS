Windstille Bugs
===============

- changing the direction of animation 2 times at the same frame often causes the
  animation to finish too early (press down 2 times fastly to see this)
- when standing up from ducking there's a small delay as we blend animations
  like this: ducking -> stand -> walk. We should rather blend ducking -> walk to
  avoid 1 unnecessary frame.
