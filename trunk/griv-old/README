griv 
=====

griv is a image viewer that allows you to directly zoom into
thumbnails. Its goal is to allow its viewer to view 100'000 images at
once, fluently without any noticable load times.

Usage:
======

You can view any collectino of files in a directory by:

 $ ./griv [PATHNAME]...

Optionally you can pre-generate the thumbnails, which results in
a smoother experience by calling (strongly recomment):

 $ ./thumbgen -a [PATHNAME]...

For very large image collections it is recomment that you pregenerate
the URL list to avoid slow startup due to file-io:

 $ find  PATH -type f -name "*.jpg" | sed "s/^/file:\/\//" > /tmp/url.lst
 $ ./griv -f /tmp/url.lst

Things you shouldn't do:
========================

Avoid running two instances at once, griv doesn't do any filelocking,
so you my end up trashing your cache.
